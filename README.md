# Sentiment Analysis

What is Sentiment Analysis? Put a few paragraphs here

## Overview

In this notebook we are going to use the IMDB Review dataset compiled by Stanford (add a link here). This dataset has 50,000 reviews, half of which are used for training and the other half for testing. This is a binary classification problem where the classes are either 'positive' or 'negative'.

The IMDB dataset is has been downloaded from [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) and unzipped into the 'data' directory.

Note: Keras has a built-in function to access this database but we want to manually perform the preprocessing

## Layout of this Project

This needs a proper write-up

Steps:
1. get the data
2. clean the data
3. examine the data
4. make a basic model
5. parameter sweep
6. more complicated models
