# Sentiment Analysis

In this notebook we are going to use the IMDB Review dataset compiled by Stanford (add a link here). This dataset has 50,000 reviews, half of which are used for training and the other half for testing. This is a binary classification problem where the classes are either 'positive' or 'negative'.
